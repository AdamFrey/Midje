1. improve formula failure reporting
  a. report the first failure
  
2. implement shrinking.  Report only the first fully shrunken failure

3. don't run more tests than need be if there is alreadya failure in this formula's batch.

4. consider implementing with @marick's metaconstant syntax

5. shrink function overrides
  a. no shrink
  
6. if we do metaconstant style, implement generator overriding
