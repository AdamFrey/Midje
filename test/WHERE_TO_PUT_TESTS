Midje has three test directories with three different
purposes.

WARNING: As with all categories
http://www.exampler.com/testing-com/writings/pnsqc-2005-communication.pdf
these have fuzzy boundaries. Moreover, the categories have
evolved, so there are a number of tests in the wrong
category. But maintainers should try to make things
less-wrong.

as_documentation
    The wiki user documentation is intended to be a good
    guide for users. The `as-documentation` tests should
    serve as a useful supplement. That means that these
    tests should (1) have extra-good explanations and
    variable names, and (2) be restricted to information an
    expert user would want to know. Details and things that
    "should just work in the obvious way" should go
    elsewhere. 

behaviors
    These tests are written using the midje.sweet
    namespace. That is, they don't reach "under the
    hood". They, however, explore behaviors that are
    visible to the user, but not one she wants to learn
    about. For example, the details of line number
    calculation aren't relevant to the user: it should just
    work. So a test about line numbers doesn't belong
    in `as-documentation`. Since it's important and directly
    user-visible behavior, it doesn't belong in `midje`. So
    it goes here.

midje
    Test namespaces here correspond one-to-one to source
    namespaces. The tests here are about internal
    mechanism. It's best if user-visible behavior is tested
    in one of the above two categories.

    Someday I may rename this namespace `internals`.
