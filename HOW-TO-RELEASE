The process for pushing a new version is too complicated and
manual. 

* Update HISTORY
* Run configuration tests (HOW-TO-CONFIGURATION-TEST
  with midje-version set to a non-snapshot value.
  (Note that this uploads.)

* DO NOT CLEAN.
* Use bin/update-project-files and bin/version to set the examples
  appropriately. For example:
      bin/update-project-files 1.3.0
      bin/version 1.3.0 1.2.1 1.2.0
* bin/gather-downloads
* Update README.md (including version number)
* Commit
* git tag -a -m "message" v.x.x.x   ;; git push --tags
* Push to github

* Update example page, if needed.
* Try out downloads.
