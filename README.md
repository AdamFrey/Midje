About Midje
=======================

Midje is a test framework for Clojure. I created it to allow
programmers to [test with
ease](http://exampler.com/ease-and-joy.html), 
to provide a [smooth migration path from
clojure.test](https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/A-tutorial-introduction-for-Clojure.test-users),
to support [top-down](https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/The-idea-behind-top-down-development) as well as bottom-up testing,
to encourage readable tests,
to support a balance between [abstraction and
concreteness](https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Metaconstants),
and to be gracious in its treatment of its users.

Gallery
=======================

To make tests more readable, Midje makes them look like
examples in Clojure books. Here's how  *[The Joy of
Clojure](http://www.amazon.com/The-Joy-Clojure-Thinking-Way/dp/1935182641)*
uses syntax to explain Clojure:

Here's the same fact about Clojure in Midje, expressed in a
way that's just as readable but also machine-checkable:
