In an effort to make Midje easier for contributors, it's
being divided into these main directories:

parsing
        All the code that parses Midje facts and other
        macro-like structures. Some of this code is hairy.

data
        Where to look to see what a data structure looks
        like. For the most part, this is "dumb data".

checking
        All the code that executes at runtime to determine
        whether some claim is true or false.

emission
        The code that is responsible for producing output
        and for maintaining counts used in that output.
