The process for pushing a new version is too complicated and
manual. 

* Touch the new version number whenever its used. 
* Run the tests.
* make jar and rename it to midje-x.x.x.jar
* make pom
* scp pom.xml midje-x.x.x.jar clojars@clojars.org:
* Run the example and compare to stashed result. (It should
  fetch the new version.)
* Make new downloads
* git tag -a -m "message" v.x.x.x
* Push to github
