The process for pushing a new version is too complicated and
manual. 

* Touch the new version number whenever its used. 
   (Should only be in the project files.)
* Run the tests.
* lein jar and rename it to midje-x.x.x.jar
* lein pom
* scp pom.xml midje-x.x.x.jar clojars@clojars.org:
* Go to the example, 'lein clean', and 'lein deps'. (It should fetch the
  new version.)
* Run the example and compare to stashed result. 
* Make a new version of 'run' in the example directory. 
* Try it out against the expected output.
* DO NOT CLEAN.
* Make new downloads
* git tag -a -m "message" v.x.x.x   ;; git push --tags
* Push to github
