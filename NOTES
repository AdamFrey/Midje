The process for pushing a new version is too complicated and
manual. 

* Touch the new version number whenever its used. 
   (Should only be in the project files.)
* Rake fresh
* Rake upload
* Go to the example, 'lein clean', and 'lein deps'. (It should fetch the
  new version.)
* Make a new version of 'run' in the example directory. 
* Run the example with 'run' and compare to stashed result. 
* Try it out again with lein; check expected output
* DO NOT CLEAN.
* Make new downloads
* Commit
* git tag -a -m "message" v.x.x.x   ;; git push --tags
* Push to github
