The process is too manual. 

== Assumptions:
* The midje-version is something like 1.3.0-SNAPSHOT

== To pick a new Clojure version for the main test suite:

* rake fresh
* One of:

bin/version <midje-version>  1.2.0 1.2.0
bin/version <midje-version>  1.2.1 1.2.0
bin/version <midje-version>  1.3.0
bin/version <midje-version>  1.4.0-alphaN

== To run a larger compatibility suite:

* bin/update-project-files <midje-version>
* rake fresh
* rake upload
* bin/compatibility <midje-version>
